### THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

### WHEN asked for character types to include in the password

### THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

### WHEN I answer each prompt

### THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

### WHEN all prompts are answered
